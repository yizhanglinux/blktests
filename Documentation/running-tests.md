# Running Tests

The `./check` script executes tests. `./check` exits with a zero exit status if
all tests passed and non-zero otherwise.

## Test Organization

Tests are split up into various groups, which are the subdirectories of the
`tests` directory. For example, `tests/loop` contains tests for loop devices,
and `tests/block` contains generic block layer tests.

`./check` can execute individual tests or test groups. For example,

```sh
./check loop block/002
```

will run all tests in the `loop` group and the `block/002` test.

## Configuration

Test configuration goes in the `config` file at the top-level directory of the
blktests repository. A different file can be specified with the `-c` command
line option. The `-c` option can be used multiple times; the files will all be
loaded in the order that they are specified on the command line.

Test configuration options can also be set as environment variables. The
configuration file has precedence over environment variables, and command line
options have precedence over the configuration file.

### Test Devices

Some test cases require a block device for testing. These test cases implement
a special test function test_device(). The `TEST_DEVS` variable is an array of
block devices that such test cases to test on. Every test will be run on each of
these devices where applicable. Note that tests are destructive and will
overwrite any data on these devices.

```sh
TEST_DEVS=(/dev/nvme0n1 /dev/sdb)
```

If `TEST_DEVS` is not defined or is empty, only tests which do not require a
device will be run, which implments the test function 'test()'. If `TEST_DEVS`
is defined as a normal variable instead of an array, it will be converted to an
array by splitting on whitespace.

Some test cases require multiple block devices for single test run. These test
cases implement a special test function test_device_array(). TEST_CASE_DEV_ARRAY
is an associative array which defines test devices for such test cases. In this
array, each key represents a test case name or a regular expression to match
test case names. Each key's corresponding value is a list of devices associated
with the test case. The test cases run for all of the devices specified in the
list. Again, note that tests are destructive and will overwrite any data on
these devices.

```sh
TEST_CASE_DEV_ARRAY[md/003]="/dev/nvme0n1 /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 /dev/nvme3n1"
TEST_CASE_DEV_ARRAY[meta/02*]="/dev/nvme0n1 /dev/nvme1n1"
```

### Excluding Tests


The `EXCLUDE` variable is an array of tests or test groups to exclude. This
corresponds to the `-x` command line option.

```sh
EXCLUDE=(loop block/001)
```

Tests specified explicitly on the command line will always run even if they are
in `EXCLUDE`.

If `EXCLUDE` is defined as a normal variable instead of an array, it will be
converted to an array by splitting on whitespace.

### Quick Runs and Test Timeouts

Many tests can take a long time to run. By setting the `TIMEOUT` variable, you
can limit the runtime of each test to a specific length (in seconds).

```sh
TIMEOUT=60
```

Note that not all tests honor this timeout. You can define the `QUICK_RUN`
variable in addition to `TIMEOUT` to specify that only tests which honor the
timeout or are otherwise "quick" should run. This corresponds to the `-q`
command line option.

```sh
QUICK_RUN=1
TIMEOUT=30
```

### Device-Only Runs

Sometimes it's useful to only run tests which exercise the configured test
devices (e.g., in order to test the device driver itself). This can be done by
passing the `-d` command line option or setting the `DEVICE_ONLY` variable.

```sh
DEVICE_ONLY=1
```

### Zoned Block Device

To run test cases for zoned block devices, set the `RUN_ZONED_TESTS` variable.
When this variable is set and a test case can prepare a virtual device such as
`null_blk` with zoned mode, the test case is executed twice: first in non-zoned
mode and second in zoned mode. The use of the `RUN_ZONED_TESTS` variable
requires that the kernel be compiled with `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED` enabled.
```sh
RUN_ZONED_TESTS=1
```

### NVMe test parameterizing

The NVMe tests can be additionally parameterized via environment variables.

- NVMET_TRTYPES: 'loop' (default), 'tcp', 'rdma' and 'fc'
  Set up NVME target backends with the specified transport. Multiple transports
  can be listed with separating spaces, e.g., "loop tcp rdma". In this case, the
  tests are repeated to cover all of the transports specified.
  This parameter had an old name 'nvme_trtype'. The old name is still usable,
  but not recommended.
- NVMET_BLKDEV_TYPES: 'device', 'file'
  Set up NVME target backends with the specified block device type. Multiple
  block device types can be listed with separating spaces. In this case, the
  tests are repeated to cover all of the block device types specified. Default
  value is "device file".
- NVME_IMG_SIZE: '1G' (default)
  Run the tests with given image size in bytes. 'm', 'M', 'g' and 'G' postfix
  are supported. This parameter had an old name 'nvme_img_size'. The old name
  is still usable, but not recommended.
- NVME_NUM_ITER: 1000 (default)
  The number of iterations a test should do. This parameter had an old name
  'nvme_num_iter'. The old name is still usable, but not recommended.
- NVME_TARGET_CONTROL: When defined, the generic target setup/cleanup code will
  be skipped and this script gets called. This makes it possible to run
  the fabric nvme tests against a real target.

#### NVMe-TCP zero-copy offload

The NVMe-TCP ZC offload tests use a couple more variables.

- KERNELSRC: Path to running kernel sources.
  Needed for the script to configure the offload.
- NVME_IFACE: Name of the interface the offload should be enabled on.
  This should be the same interface the NVMe connection is made with.

### Running nvme-rdma nvmeof-mp and SRP tests

These tests will use the siw (soft-iWARP) driver by default. The rdma_rxe
(soft-RoCE) driver is also supported.

```sh
To use the siw driver:
NVMET_TRTYPES=rdma ./check nvme/
./check nvmeof-mp/
./check srp/

To use the rdma_rxe driver:
USE_RXE=1 NVMET_TRTYPES=rdma ./check nvme/
USE_RXE=1 ./check srp/
```
'USE_RXE' had the old name 'use_rxe'. The old name is still usable but not
recommended.

### Normal user

To run test cases which require normal user privilege, prepare a user and
specify it to the `NORMAL_USER` variable. The test cases are skipped unless a
valid user is specified.

```sh
NORMAL_USER=blktests_user
```

### Custom Setup

The `config` file is really just a bash file that is sourced at the beginning
of the test run, so it can be used to do any special setup you need. For
example, you could configure `PATH` to find an executable you built from
source:

```sh
export PATH="/root/fio:$PATH"
```

Or, if your setup doesn't mount `configfs` automatically (it probably does),
you could mount it:

```sh
if ! findmnt -t configfs /sys/kernel/config > /dev/null; then
	mount -t configfs configfs /sys/kernel/config
fi
```
### NVME_TARGET_CONTROL

When NVME_TARGET_CONTROL is set, blktests will call the script which the
environment variable points to, to fetch the configuration values to be used for
the runs, e.g subsysnqn or hostnqn. This allows the blktest to be run against
external configured/setup targets.

The blktests expects that the script interface implements following
commands:

config:
  --show-blkdev-type
  --show-trtype
  --show-hostnqn
  --show-hostid
  --show-host-traddr
  --show-traddr
  --show-trsvid
  --show-subsys-uuid
  --show-subsysnqn

setup:
  --subsysnqn SUBSYSNQN
  --subsys-uuid SUBSYS_UUID
  --hostnqn HOSTNQN
  --ctrlkey CTRLKEY
  --hostkey HOSTKEY

cleanup:
  --subsysnqn SUBSYSNQN
